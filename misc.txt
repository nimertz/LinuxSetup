The default font rendering in Pop!_OS may appear blurry on LCD monitors. Gnome's OS settings application lacks the ability to change font rendering. You must install the Gnome Tweak Tool to adjust these settings. Gnome Tweak Tool can be installed from the Pop!_Shop or from a terminal as shown below:

    Run gnome-tweaks
    Fonts > Hinting > Set to "Full"
    Fonts > Antialiasing > Set to "Subpixel (for LCD screens)"

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email yourname@yourdomain.com
